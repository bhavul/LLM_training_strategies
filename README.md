# Large Language Models Training Strategies

Over the last few months as I've been reading up on LLMs, I have realised that deep within the actual papers lie some great advice on training strategies, tweaks made to data, choice of hyperparamters and such which get lost in the noise of hype. 

This repository will serve as an index detailing various strategies, tweaks, and recent architectural or hyperparameter choices made by different large language models.
